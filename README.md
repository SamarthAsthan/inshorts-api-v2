# :mag: Usage

You can use either of the categories from [News Categories](#card_file_box-news-categories)

**Base endpoint :** `https://inshortsv2.vercel.app/news`

Make a `GET`request to the **Base endpoint** with the name of the category to get the corresponding news in JSON format

```
https://inshortsv2.vercel.app/news?type={category name}
```

**Example** - https://inshortsv2.vercel.app/news?type=all_news

To limit the number of results per page, add `{limit}` at the end of the API url.

**Example** - https://inshortsv2.vercel.app/news?type=all_news&limit=23 
- This will limit the results to 23 for that request.

> **NOTE :** If no limit is provided, default limit is set to 10 results per page.
